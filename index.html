            <p>
                In biology class, I had a brief introduction to solutes and solvents.
                During the lecture, it was said that there are 3 factors that affect the rate of dissolution: <br>
                <li>
                    (1) the surface area of the solute
                </li>
                <li>
                    <mark> (2) the temperature of the solvent</mark>
                </li>
                <li>
                    (3) the amount of agitation that occurs when the solute and the solvent are mixed.
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                The factor that I want to test is the temperature of the solvent.
                The water on the left is very hot to the touch, the one in the center
                room temperature (about 65-70F), and the one on the right is the ice cold water.
                The temperatures are relative since I don't have any thermometer on hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here the surface areas are the same for each solution and there is no agitation taking
                place to any of the solutions. This way, I can focus on the main factor which is a change in
                temperature.
            </p>

                Things I would change:
            </h4>

            <li>
                Lighting should be more front facing instead of from the side
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a cold water that doesn't have ice chunks inside
            </li>
            <li>
                Get temperature for each water bottle
            </li>
            <li>
                Instead of waterbottles, use clear glass without deformations to see reaction better
            </li>
